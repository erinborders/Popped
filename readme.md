# Popped

# Overview

Pop up events are awesome - they're quick, fun, and a great promotional tool for shops and restaurants that already have a fanbase. But what about lesser known businesses? Pop up events are fast and depend almost entirely on the social media marketing of the company, so it's pretty much impossible to know about one if you're not friends with - or already - a fan of that particular brand. That's where Popped comes in. It compiles all local pop up events in Atlanta so that you never have to miss one again. Help support your favorite stores or find new ones with this web application!
